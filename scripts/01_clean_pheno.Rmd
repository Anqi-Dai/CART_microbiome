## Valid patient samples

```{r}
# the newest pheno table from M
# this sheet have nice sampleids for the samples, and also this is the table has all of the info
phe_M <- read_excel('/Volumes/castoricenter/CAR-Tcell_and_Microbiota/CTC Event Table 10232019 wo Censor .xlsx',
                    sheet = 5)
```

```{r}
# selecting the columns relavant to this study
phe_M_clean <- phe_M %>% 
   rename_all(funs(str_replace_all(., ' \\(.+$','') %>% 
    str_replace_all(., ' ','_') %>% 
    str_replace(., ':','_'))) %>% 
  # select the columns that may be relavant

         Censor_reason,

# this is all of the baseline samples that has 16s.

## Valid shotgun data


```{r}

have_sg <- read_csv('../data/baselinesforAngel10032019.csv') %>% 
  filter(shotgun_YN == 'yes') %>%

  filter(sample_id != '1943A') %>% 
  ### FUCK THIS TABLE OF ../data/baselinesforAngel10032019.csv IS WRONG IN 161, it didnâ€™t pass QC because not enough DNA material was present. SO WE DON'T HAVE THE SHOTGUN DATA.
  filter(!sample_id %in% c('161'))

nrow(have_sg)
  


```

## Overlap: the real valid shotgun samples

```{r}
# visualize the difference 
two <- Venn(list(
  have_file = have_sg$sample_id,
  useable = phe_M_clean$Sampleid
))  
  
ggvenn(two)      


# so the final shotgun samples number will be 33
length(intersect(have_sg$sample_id, phe_M_clean$Sampleid))

final_sample_id <- intersect(have_sg$sample_id, phe_M_clean$Sampleid)

# so the final removed 2 samples are:
setdiff(pheno_col$Sampleid, final_sample_id) 
```

```{r}

final_pheno <- phe_M_clean %>%

```
